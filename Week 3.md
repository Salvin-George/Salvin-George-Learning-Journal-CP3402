## Learning Activities & Resources

- This week I set up a wordpress.com site using thier built-in editor and transfered the content over from the Joomla Site. I also completed the group formation interview activity, which was treated as a learning exercise in teamwork and employability. During this activity, I conducted short, interview-style conversations with classmates, asking structured questions about how they approach problem-solving, overcome roadblocks, and what they value in group members.


## Resources used:

- https://wordpress.org/support/article/getting-started-with-wordpress/
- https://wordpress.org/support/article/pages/
- In-class peer interviews and discussion


## Estimated Hours

- About 5h, over 3 days

## Content Insights

- Learning WordPress after using Joomla helped me clarify how different CMS's approach content management and site structure. WordPress is more page-focused and intuitive for quickly building a site, with content creation and navigation closely linked. This made it easier to replicate the startup site created in Joomla with minimal effort. Generally I prefer Wordpresses more intutive interface as compared to Joomla's design workflow.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

- The group interview activity provided some deep insight into how people work in team environments and how employability skills and technical ability factor into people's perception of a "good team member". When asked how they overcome roadblocks, most participants said they prefered researching solutions and seeking help from group members or tutors, while one participant perfered efficiency and following official instructions over collaboraitive work. This showed that while research is a common strategy, individuals differ in how independently or collaboratively they approach challenges. Although all interviews generally had similar approaches to problem solving. When discussing what they value in group members, recurring themes included responsibility, reliability, competence, and shared leadership. Several participants expressed a preference for co-leadership rather than a single leader, suggesting that many students value collaboration and shared accountability. This reinforced the importance of clear expectations, communication, and reliability in group work.
