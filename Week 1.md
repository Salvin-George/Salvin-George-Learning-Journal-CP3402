## Estimated Hours

- About 5 hours

## Content Insights

- This week helped me relearn the difference between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I re-learned that HTML should focus on structure and meaning, while CSS controls presentation and layout, and JavaScript is responsible for behaviour and interactivity. Using Bootstrap made this separation clearer, as many layout and styling decisions are handled through predefined classes rather than custom CSS.

## Career / Employability / Learning Insights

- Publishing the site to GitHub Pages highlighted the importance of version control and what developers commonly use to manage and build projects. This week also made it clear that comfort with tools like GitHub, Markdown, and CSS frameworks directly improves employability, as these tools are commonly used across both development and content-management roles.
