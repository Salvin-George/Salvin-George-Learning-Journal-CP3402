## Learning Activities & Resources

- This week I focused on learning how to set up a local development environment for a WordPress site and understanding how WordPress operates. I used LocalWP to install and configure WordPress on my local machine and reviewed WordPress documentation that helped me install it and set it up.


## Resources used:

- https://localwp.com/help-docs/
- https://wordpress.org/support/article/installing-wordpress-on-your-own-computer/
- https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/



## Estimated Hours

- About 4 hours


## Content Insights

- Setting up WordPress locally helped me undertstand prototyping and development as running the site on localhost allows changes to be tested safely without affecting a live site. This made it easier to experiment with themes, pages, and configuration while maintaining confidence that mistakes would not impact a production environment.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

- From a learning perspective, using a tool like LocalWP reduced setup complexity and allowed me to focus on understanding how WordPress works rather than struggling with manual server configuration.
