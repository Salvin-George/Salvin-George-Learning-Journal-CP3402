# Learning Journal – Prac 2: Introduction to Joomla CMS
### Week: Prac 2
### Link: https://decisiontraceweb.joomla.com/


## Learning Activities & Resources

- This week I focused on learning how Joomla works as a content management system rather than just building pages. After completing the practical tasks, I reviewed Joomla’s official documentation to better understand its core concepts, particularly how content, menus, and templates interact. I also used short tutorial videos to clarify parts of the Joomla administrator interface that were confusing during the prac, especially around menu management and template customisation.

## Resources used:

- https://docs.joomla.org/Portal:Beginners
- https://www.cloudaccess.net/joomla-knowledgebase/138-joomla-3-1/getting-started/774-tutorial-3-using-templates-joomla-3-2.html

## Estimated Hours

- Approximately 3 hours

## Content Insights

- Through this prac I gained a clearer understanding of how Joomla operates and how to construct a website using a CMS such as Joomla, this also helped me appreciate the complexity and work that goes into constucting professional and functional websites.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

- This week highlighted the importance of understanding why a system works the way it does, rather than just learning which buttons to click. I also noticed that watching longer tutorial videos was less effective for me than short, targeted resources & videos immediately after encountering a problem. In future weeks, I plan to continue this approach by identifying gaps during practical work and then using focused documentation or short tutorials to address them, rather than trying to learn everything in advance.
